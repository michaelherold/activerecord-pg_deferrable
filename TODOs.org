* TODO Patch add_index

Look into both of these:

- [ ] activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/schema_statements.rb
- [ ] activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/schema_statements.rb

* TODO Add documentation

* TODO Write readme

* TODO Investigate whether this will work for SQLite as well

SQLite also [[https://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_deferred][supports deferred constraints]] (at least for foreign keys) so it
should work since this is standard SQL.

* TODO Attempt to figure out a way to map errors

I'm not sure this will work because the error message is about what the
violation is, not the violating row, and it pops with the transaction commit,
not the statement.

[[https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-08-27-deferrable-sql-constraints.html#harder-troubleshooting][This article]] suggests that it won't be a doable, but it's worth a shot.
